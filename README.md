==================

An example that offers ideas on how to get started with a JavaScript-based HTML5 text adventure game.

items: knife, flashlight, 2 keys (one for the safe, one inside the safe to open the coffin)
actions: move/goto, jump, pickup, drop, shine, stab
locations: bathroom, bedroom, dining hall, hallway, kitchen, ball room, living room, basement

plot: invited to dinner party at a house and the owner tells you that a dead body was buried somewhere inside the house - up to you to find it - along the way you run into 2 protectors of the body (ghost and 3 headed snake) - ghost is defeated by shining the light on him and the snake is defeated by stabbing it in the eyes - body is locked away so you need to find a key which will be located in a safe (need to find the safe key first)

bathroom - knife will be located behind the toilet
bedroom - flashlight will be located in top drawer
dining hall - ghost lives on top of chandelier
hallway
kitchen - safe with body key inside
ball room - safe key located under table
living room
basement - where 3 headed snake resides
